        <p>Hi there. I'm Anya Hirota.</p>
        <br />

          I am a full stack software engineer with a love for frontend design
          and a passion for building user-focused applications. I have
          experience working as an engineer in the financial services and
          e-commerce industries, building internal tools and client-facing
          dashboards. I am an avid communicator and enjoy learning new skills in
          and out of the office.

        <p>My journey as a software engineer has been unconventional.</p>

          Born and raised in San Francisco, I spent my youth in various art
          classes and theater productions, attending Ruth Asawa School of the
          Arts. I started university at UC Santa Barbara, but spent a year
          abroad in Japan and Germany. Craving a new adventure, I decided to
          relocate to the UK, gaining my degree in business management with a
          focus of global industries from Pearson College London.

          I graduated in March of 2020. While this time was challenging for many
          reasons, the silver lining was that it allowed me to take a step back
          and determine what I really wanted as a new graduate - and for me,
          that was working in an innovative technical space. I moved back to San
          Francisco and knew I needed a few more technical skills to thrive. So
          I started giving coding a try. And I am so glad I did! Initially
          thinking it would help inform my more business-focused role, I found
          myself really loving the development process and the tangible results
          of building applications. I donâ€™t know if there was a single moment I
          knew I wanted to be a software engineer, but through the joy of
          learning and the satisfaction of seeing my code come to life, I found
          my path.
